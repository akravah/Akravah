export const MemorialDesc = `This building serves as the tomb and memorial of Forough Farrokhzad,
     a prominent contemporary Iranian writer and poet. It encompasses the poet's tomb, a museum,
     a library, study and research facilities, a conference hall, and a coffee shop. The architectural
      design of this structure prioritizes horizontal lines and low building heights to evoke feelings of
     tranquility, serenity, and balance. Numerous seating areas are incorporated into the design to offer
     opportunities for introspection and contemplation within the space. Water features are strategically
     integrated along pathways, symbolizing purity and peace, and contributing to the spiritual ambiance.
      The tomb's lower elevation relative to its surroundings enhances its sense of seclusion and tranquility.`;

    architecturally distinct buildings, each serving a unique purpose. Designed with the intention of
    cultivating an immersive experience for guests, the architecture seeks to foster a sense of tranquility,
    aligning with the pursuit of inner peace, a fundamental aspiration of human existence.
    At the heart of the complex stands a towering structure offering panoramic vistas, providing an ideal setting
     for meditation and contemplation. Surrounding this central focal point are amenities including a spacious
      yoga hall, luxurious massage suites complemented by a swimming pool, and a designated area for children's
      entertainment. Additionally, a charming restaurant invites guests to indulge in culinary delights amidst

     and lush greenery, all meticulously integrated to evoke the essence of nature and imbue the environment
      with a profound sense of serenity.`;

      the brand's core color palette. The building is crafted to offer customers not only a space
       to try and purchase products but also an immersive experience in the brand's identity and ambiance.`;

export const WonderlandDesc = `This project is an intersection of fashion and technology. Inspired by the timeless

      the project brings to life a series of captivating scenes, each intricately designed to evoke the whimsical
       essence of Wonderland, including three dresses inspired by the main characters of the narrative.
        From enchanted forests to royal palaces, users are transported to a world where fashion becomes a vehicle
         for self-expression and narrative exploration. Through this innovative blend of technology and creativity
         , the project showcases the limitless possibilities of VR in revolutionizing fashion presentation
          and engaging audiences in immersive experiences.`;
